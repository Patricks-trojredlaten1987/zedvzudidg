OMG, just finished watching Cleaner and I am like, what even was that?! 😂 Seriously, it's one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you question your life choices at 2 AM. Like, why did I choose this movie? Anyway, Samuel L. Jackson is a total legend, as always, but some parts just went all over the place, like they were trying to squeeze in every plot twist ever. 

Honestly, I almost dozed off halfway through but then BAM – some wild twist hit and I was wide awake again. You ever watch a movie and feel like it's trying to mess with your brain? That was Cleaner for sure. It's like they downloaded the movie from a parallel universe just to mess with us. 

> But hey, it was kinda fun, not gonna lie. I mean, I'm tired, but it was worth it just to see how they'd try to wrap up all those loose ends. Spoiler: they kinda didn’t 🤷‍♀️. Did you get around to the last scene? It's like they were trying to make it all deep and meaningful, and I’m just sitting here sipping my cold coffee being like, Okay dude, sure.

And oh! Before I forget – note to self, never try to watch a movie this intense without snacks. Seriously, the suspense has me stress-eating air. Maybe popcorn next time? Gotta prep for this emotional rollercoaster, haha! 

function magicSpoiler(){ why did I even just write that? I’m losing it. 😂

Anyway, if you get a chance, watch the movie just for Samuel's epic lines. But maybe catch it when you're not feeling like a zombie. Or zombie vibes might just match the whole whacky pace, you know what I mean? 😂
